# Critical Essay Writer Agentic Workflow 

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project implements an agentic workflow that writes critical essays by simulating a humanâ€™s reflective thinking process.
The workflow is designed to iteratively improve the quality of writing by combining generation, reflection, and revision steps using LLMs.

It follows a three-step reflection pattern to emulate how a human writer drafts, reviews, and refines their work.

## Agentic Workflow

* **Step 1 â€“ Drafting:** The workflow calls an LLM to generate an initial essay draft based on a simple prompt.

* **Step 2 â€“ Reflection:** The model performs a reflection pass, analyzing the draft to identify weaknesses, logical gaps, tone inconsistencies, or unclear reasoning.

* **Step 3 â€“ Revision:** The system then applies the feedback generated from reflection to rewrite the essay, improving clarity, coherence, and argumentation strength.

## ðŸ§© LLM Model Used

Model: gpt-4o

Purpose: Used for both drafting and reflective reasoning.

Key Features:

- Multi-turn reasoning with memory of prior outputs

- Support for reflection-based task decomposition

- High-quality natural language generation suitable for long-form essays

- Consistent logical flow and context retention across steps

ðŸš€ Use Cases

Academic Writing: Automate the generation of critical essays with coherent structure and deep reasoning.

Reflective AI Systems: Demonstrate how agentic AI can emulate human-like self-evaluation and iterative thinking.

Educational Tools: Help students learn writing improvement through reflection and revision cycles.
