# 🧠 Agentic AI – Reflection Design Pattern

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository demonstrates how Agentic AI workflows can simulate human-like reflection, reasoning, and improvement across different domains.
Each workflow follows the Reflection Design Pattern, where an agent iteratively generates, evaluates, and refines its outputs to improve performance and quality.

The repo includes three independent examples:

- Chart Generation

- SQL Generation

- Research Agent (Essay Writing)

Each subproject showcases how a multi-step agentic workflow can be implemented using OpenAI GPT models to perform generation → reflection → revision cycles.

# 🧠 What is the Reflection Design Pattern?

The Reflection Design Pattern structures an AI agent’s workflow into iterative reasoning loops:

- Generate: Create an initial output (e.g., draft, chart, SQL query).

- Reflect: Critically analyze the output to find weaknesses or improvement points.

- Revise: Apply the feedback to produce an improved version.

This approach enables an LLM to act like a self-improving system, emulating human cognition — draft → critique → rewrite.

# 🧭 Workflows
1. 📊 Chart Generation Workflow

Goal: Automatically generate insightful visualizations from text-based instructions or data descriptions.

- Generates charts using reflection cycles (draft → critique → regenerate).

- Example: “Visualize weekly sales trends with annotations for promotion weeks.”

2. 🧮 Text-to-SQL Generation Workflow

Goal: Convert natural language questions into optimized SQL queries using reflection-based reasoning.

- Step 1: Draft SQL query

- Step 2: Critique SQL correctness and completeness

- Step 3: Refine query for better accuracy and performance

3. ✍️ Research Agent Workflow

Goal: Write critical essays or reports through a self-reflective writing process.

- Step 1: Draft essay

- Step 2: Reflect and provide feedback

- Step 3: Revise essay for clarity, coherence, and argumentation strength
